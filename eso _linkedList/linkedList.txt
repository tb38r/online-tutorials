LLs are a linear data structure in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory lcoations
Consists of nodes (which contain data) with a ref/pointer(called next) to the next nodes
First initial a node (a struct)

//Arrays: good for modifying certain elements
//Linked List : good for inserting or deleting an element 

Big O notation ish:
Time to delete item in a LL is constant regardless of its size (untrue for arrays in comp)
Memory space required for storage in aLL increaes linearly (as opposedto exponentially/irregular elsewhere)

Each element is a node [data|pointer to next node]
Head node - First node in a List
Tail - last node

To create create new node, fill data and fill reference to previous head, reclassify new head
